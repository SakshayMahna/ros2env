## 🧪 Getting Started

Here’s how to start using **ros2env** to manage your ROS 2 environments.

### 📁 1. Open or create a ROS2 project in VS Code

Open any folder where you plan to work on your ROS2 project.

> If you don’t have a workspace yet, no problem — `ros2env` creates one for you.


### ➕ 2. Create a new ROS2 Environment

1. Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
2. Run: `ROS2: Create Environment`
3. Enter a name for your new environment (e.g., `my_ros2env`)
4. Choose a ROS 2 distro (e.g., `humble`, `foxy`, etc.)
5. Wait for setup to complete (you’ll see progress)

🎉 A new isolated ROS2 environment will be created with a ready to use workspace.


### 🔁 3. Load (Switch to) an Environment

1. Open Command Palette again
2. Run: `ROS2: Load Environment`
3. Select one of your previously created environments

This will:
- Start the environment (if stopped)
- Stop any running environment (if different)
- Attach an interactive terminal inside `ros2_ws`


### 💻 4. Open a ROS 2 Terminal

- Run: `ROS2: Open Terminal`
- This opens a terminal already inside your ROS2 workspace

You're ready to build, source, and run ROS2 nodes like usual.


### 🖥️ 5. Launch GUI Tools

- Run: `ROS2: Open GUI`
- This opens a browser tab with access to graphical tools (RViz, Gazebo, etc.)

> GUI support is provided via an embedded desktop accessible through your browser.


### 🛑 6. Stop an Environment

- Run: `ROS2: Stop Environment`
- This shuts down the running environment and closes terminals


### 🗑️ 7. Delete an Environment

- Run: `ROS2: Delete Environment`
- Select one or more environments to remove permanently

⚠️ This will stop and delete the selected environments. Use with caution.
